            A computer program was created with the ability to determine the possibility and location of a cyanobacteria algae bloom within the next 4 to 7 days. The algorithm uses the nitrate, saline, and temperature levels from 10 sites in the Indian River Lagoon and St. Lucie Estuary. These measurements were taken with Harbor Branch’s LOBO network and data thresholds from previous individual research.<br><br>
            Using an algorithm created in this project, a computer is able to predict cyanobacteria algae blooms in the Indian River Lagoon and St. Lucie Estuary (IRL/SLE) with 93% accuracy. The computer program also predicts general cause of the algae bloom and suggests preventive measures to limit the severity of these bloom.
            The computer program is a Node.JS application built on the Express framework using MySQL, Pusher, and EJS webpages as well as numerous other technologies. <br><br>
            In addition to the computer program, an iOS application (in Swift with the Cocoa Touch framework) was built with the ability to send local notifications to an iPhone warning about possible cyanobacteria blooms within 4 to 7 days. For policy-makers, the phone application could be used as an early-warning system. After a policy-maker has been alerted of the algal bloom, they could follow the suggested preventive measure suggested by the app to mitigate the severity of the algal bloom that is predicted to occur.<br><br>
            Through the use of the computer application and public support, the threat of cyanobacteria blooms could be mitigated.

            Microcystin-LR, commonly found in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), is the predominant toxin in species of cyanobacteria that cause harm to plants. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) detriments the growth of plants causing biomass and yield to be reduced.<br><br>
            Along with the negative effects of MC-LR, adding blue-green algae to soil has been found to increase nitrogen levels in the soil which decreases the Carbon : Nitrogen ratio resulting in a slower rate of growth or inhibition of germination.<br><br>
            In this experiment, cyanobacteria was added to tomatoes and radishes and the effect on biomass was measured. This was done to determine the effect that MC-LR and green composting had on crops in the IRL.<br><br>
            For crops without fertilizer, the introduction of cyanobacteria caused the biomass to decrease by 65.3% (for tomatoes) and 41.4% (for radishes). For crops grown with fertilizer, the introduction of cyanobacteria caused the biomass to decrease by 64% (for tomatoes) and 94.5% (for radishes).<br><br>
            In addition to these outcomes, the data suggests that, in the event of an algae bloom, the introduction of fertilizer to the growth process limited biomass development by 20.1% (in tomatoes) to 88.1% (in radishes).<br><br>
            All together, this experiment shows that MC-LR and green composting have a negative effect on the remaining shoreline in the IRL and also suggests that there is a synergistic relationship between cyanobacteria (including MC-LR) and fertilizer because the two variables, in conjunction, damage biomass greater than either alone.<br><br>

          <span class="smalltext">“Investigating The Influence Of Temperature On The Synergistic Effect Of Environmental Saline And Nitrate Levels On The Proliferation Of Anabaena Variabilis”</span> <br> <br><br>
          <p class="colorBlac textBaskk">
            This project was conducted to determine if temperature influenced Anabaena variabilis proliferation in nitrate and saline conditions that were optimal for Anabaena.<br><br>
            I hypothesized that Anabaena proliferation would increase as the temperature increased in nitrate and saline conditions that were optimal for Anabaena proliferation <br><br>
            To test this, the optimal conditions for Anabaena growth were recreated (12mM Nitrate / 2ppt Saline). From there, Anabaena proliferation at 28.4°, 30.5°, 32.6°, and 34.7° Celsius was measured in a solution of 12mM Nitrate and 2ppt Saline Solution. After a 17 day incubation period, the light absorption percentage was measured. In 28.4°, 19.1% of light was absorbed by the algae. In 30.5°, 24.1% was absorbed. In 32.6°, 24.7% was absorbed. In 34.7°, 33.0% was absorbed. <br><br>
            This suggests that after 32.6° C, the Anabaena proliferation increases to reach a 33% absorption percentage at 34.7° C. <br><br>
            Based on these results, my hypothesis was supported. In optimal nitrate and saline conditions, Anabaena proliferation increases as temperature increases. <br><br>
            Based on these results, a computer program was created that could analyze these three highly influential factors affecting algae growth in the lagoon. The computer program could analyze temperature, saline, and nitrate levels from the lagoon continuously. This would allow analysts to anticipate the early onset of a blue green algae bloom which degrades the quality of the Indian River Lagoon thus potentially lessening the effects of the bloom or prevent the algae bloom all together.

          <span class="smalltext">“SYNERGISTIC RELATIONSHIPS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SALINITY AND NITRATE LEVELS ON THE PROLIFERATION OF ANABAENA VARIABILIS”</span> <br> <br><br>
          <p class="colorBlac textBaskk">
            This experiment was conducted to determine if potassium nitrate and saline have a synergistic effect on the growth of Anabaena variabilis, a cyanobacteria in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL).<br><br>
            I hypothesized that potassium nitrate and saline would have a synergistic effect on the growth of Anabaena variabilis with an increased proliferation of cells with higher potassium nitrate levels and lower saline levels.<br><br>
            To test this, I created my own scale to which I compare my results -  a Pre-Experimentation with naturally occurring levels of saline (7ppt, 23ppt, and 39ppt) in isolation and naturally occurring levels of nitrate (3mM, 6mM, 9mM) in the lagoon.  Then in the experimentation, I created four concentrations of 3mM and 7ppt (the weakest concentration), 6M and 23ppt, 9mM and 39ppt, and 12mM and 2ppt (which would appear be most ideal for Anabaena). <br><br>
            I found the mean cell proliferations of the Pre-Experimentation and compared them to the mean cell proliferations of the Experimentation and found that cell proliferation was more than 300% greater in the experimentation.<br><br>
            After finding that there was a significant difference between the Pre-Experimentation and the Experimentation, synergism is suspected because the proliferation was 300 % greater than pre-experimentation solutions - much greater than the effect of either solution isolated.<br><br>
            Cyanobacteria such as Anabaena make up the algae blooms in the Indian River Lagoon. By preventing freshwater runoff from Lake Okeechobee, reducing the introduction of untreated sewage, and by reducing fertilizer run-off, these algae blooms could be reduced.
