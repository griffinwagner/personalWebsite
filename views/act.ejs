            <p class="colorBlack">Through the Florida Science and Engineering Fair, I cultivated a passion for science and research through competitions such as the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair: The Largest Pre-College Science Competition in the World.

              <br> <br>In 9th and 10th grade, I returned to science fairs and won 2nd and 3rd place in Microbiology projects studying nutrient, saline, and temperature thresholds for proliferation of cyanobacteria. Through my research between 2016 and 2018, I worked with Dr. Eban Shor and met with leading scientists at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.

              <br><br>In 11th grade, I continued my research into Agricultural Sciences and Environmental Engineering. In the field of Agricultural Sciences, I studied the effect of Microcystin toxins on the development of crops. In the field of Environmental Engineering, I won 2nd place at State and 4th place at the International Science Fair. At the International Science fair, I met with colleagues from all over the world while presenting my research.

              <br><br>While winning international accolades are significant, Science Fair has exposed me to the pursuit of the scientific method and, through Fairs, I have worked with elite scientists incuding FIT's Dr. Pham-Ho, FAU's Dr McFarland and Dr. Hanisak, and NYU's Eban Shor.</p>

            <p class="colorBlack">The 16th Street Tribune is a local online newspaper that publishes issues regularly. In development throughout 2018, the newspaper launched in February of 2019 and, in May of 2019, the writing team of the 16th Street Tribune has produced over 30 articles in 4 issues.

              <br> <br>As the Lead Developer, I built the website and put measures in to promote engagement leading to 700 users and a retention rate of 21.2% which is very strong for the industry. In addition to developing the website, I was also the Technology Editor and Head Writer. Through my research, I conducted exclusive interviews with current and former Apple employees in my article “Think Different: Inside Apple.”


              <br><br>Through my efforts with Apple News, Flipboard, and advertising, our reach has extended beyond Vero Beach attracting over 100 international users (16%). The 16th Street Tribune plans to continue growing and expanding as we continue to publish news relevant to society and the world.

              <br><br>Through the remainder of 2019 and the first half of 2020, the 16th Street Tribune team plans to expand beyond their current audience into new fields and genres. As new writers become eager to work on the project, we hope to work with their creativity to build an online newspaper that will stand out in Vero Beach. With my exclusive interview with Apple employees and my colleagues’ numerous exclusive interviews, the 16th Street Tribune plans to capitalize on the success of first-hand reporting as we continue our journey in journalism.

            <p class="colorBlack">In Academic Games, students compete at regional, state, and national levels in mathematics, english, and history games. Equations, the mathematics game, teaches complex mathematical concepts and critical thinking. LinguiSHTIKs, the English game, teaches students grammar concepts that are not taught in school. For both of these games, I have tutored, coached, and judged elementary and middle school students at the regional level.

              <br> <br>In 2018, I was honored by becoming the Head Regional Judge for Indian River County for LinguiSHTIKs and Equations as well as the State and National coach for both games. With my new role, I coached the Indian River national LinguiSHTIKs team who won 4th place at the national level.

              <br><br>Working with students was incredibly rewarding. Teaching elementary and middle school students in math and English in a format that is engaging and informative allowed for me to create an environment and community of learning. </p>

I continued playing Equations (the math game) through my high school career and began playing LinguiSHTIKs (an English game) and Theme (a history game). In Equations and LinguiSHTIKs, <br><br> I have won state awards placing in the top 6 repeatedly. Additionally, In both Theme and LinguiSHTIKs, I have won national accolades and, in 2018, I played on the highest placing LinguiSHTIKs Combo team since the 1980s.

I continued my Mu Alpha Theta career in 2018 when my team placed 5th at the Lake Brantley Regional Competition in Pre-Calculus. I competed at both the 2017 and 2018 Mu Alpha Theta State competition.


              <br><br>In addition to competing at Mu Alpha Theta math competitions, I have volunteered at concession stands during VBHS football games to raise money for the Vero Beach Mu Alpha Theta chapter to compete at the state competition.</p>

Our team of five performed 60+ hours of sampling with the intent of determining water quality before and after the opening of a culvert on one end of the South Bills impoundment.

              <br> <br>Working with Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and the Indian River Land Trust, our team of five conducted 80 hours of volunteer work researching the impoundment and working on restoration projects.

              <br><br>Our data suggested that, while conditions improved at sites close to a culvert, the sites of an impoundment of a far distance from a culvert can experience low levels of dissolved oxygen which can lead to fish kills. This shows that the asymmetrical opening of culverts may actually be harmful to the environment.


              <br><br>After 10 weeks of sampling and analysis, we presented our findings at the Indian River Symposium to scientists all over the state of Florida. The Harbor Branch Junior Scientist Fellows Program was personally enriching allowing for our team to work with Dr. Dennis Hanisak on the real-world problems in the South Bills impoundment.

              <br><br> Due to the connections formed with scientists working with the Junior Scientist Fellows Program, I was able to continue my personal research on the Indian River Lagoon at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute performing the first Microcystin Machine Learning survey of the Indian River Lagoon. <p>
